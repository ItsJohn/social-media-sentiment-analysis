that kitkat advert bout the brown wedding dress always makes me chuckle  x
That last one means that I'm happy 
That last part and some good red wine would be the best things, though. I've been asking for the GTO for years, it's mostly habit now 
That last post was a retweet from @SuperKaylo  I found it particularily amusing, as I'm sure @Battou &amp; @Saileshonline will attest!
That last request is not for @marktudor or @helenblenkinsop. I have no interest in 'The Sound of Microwaves Vol.10' 
That last swallow of coffee was delicious. Thank you Valerie! You rock. No more kicking you today. 
That last tweet was my sister...what a ho-bag! 
That last was @magstheaxe and #S7S

That makes it worse, somehow...
