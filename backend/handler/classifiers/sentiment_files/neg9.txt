@cloverdash What crappy news  It's the same up here-I'm amazed anyone is still employed, the amount of huge cuts there's been.
@ClownLuv Priority is getting him to &quot;working actor&quot; status, since TJB isn't monetized. There's no budget at all.

@cmjoiner I really want to go out tonight, but you're not here 
@cmm82  That's no good.    Cars are so needed yet so annoying at the same time. lol
@cmogle Totally agree. That was my first thought.  Living on the edge tests resilience. Knowing for certain allows grieving &amp; moving on.
@cmonaussiecmon that was mean! 
@CMoz yep. I'm down to my local O2 store this morning. Still on the 2G iPhone = a big upgrade for me! Shame about the 2 yr contract tho
