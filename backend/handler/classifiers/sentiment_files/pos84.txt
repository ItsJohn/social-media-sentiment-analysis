Happiest girl alive! I passed the theroy test!  Whatever you did to make it happen, thank you!
happily awaken by 4 kitty cats, nuzzling and purring.

Happily listening to @leahclaire play guitar and sing while I finish getting dressed to go out.

Happiness is a warm, napping puppy. 
Happiness is not ours to take. It is ours to give. Just like love. Do not ask for it. Give it and be glad you can do it 
happiness is only real when shared 
Happiness is opening your crayon box &amp; coloring a rainbow on a card for someone who's having a rough patch. Helps cheer you up too. 
Happiness is remembering you bought some cookies with your sandwich earlier and eating them with a tall, cold glass of soymilk 
Happiness is three backups on two media types and one off-site.  
Happiness is truly transferable so if you see people without a smile today, give them one of yours 
Happiness is when what everything you think, you say and you do comes in harmony 
Happiness is, Startrek and biscuits   Khannnnn!!!
happiness is...music monday   enjoy! - grateful dead &quot;eyes&quot; â™« http://twt.fm/160506 #musicmonday
Happiness usually comes in the form of my amazing storytimes and my Harry Potter club and my occasional few and far between talks with Julia and Marisa.
