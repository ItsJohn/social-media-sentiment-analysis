@punnie That's true! The compile time is for a &quot;good reason&quot; but it gets in the way... 
@Punno That's what they tell me  I have been under some major stresses lately, so maybe. And no thank you, I'll be good, u just study ;)
@punslingerr Hehe well thanks. I was only disappointed that he never commented. 
@pup218 But....it'd melt. Once I bonded with it I'd need years of therapy to get over the ordeal of finding my baby in a veg puddle 
@Puppatoons Wah.  Still sounds like fun to me.
People walking around outside like it's normal to be outside. I want to be outside. The air is cool-perfect sleeping weather. Sad 
people who comment me and tell me to comment their pictures piss me off then you have no choice 
People who leave dogs in hot cars are mean. 
people who own a washing machine don't realize how lucky they are... my back hurts 
PEOPLE WHO STEAL......SUCK.  Daughter got her I-pod stolen from school.  Stupid kids.
