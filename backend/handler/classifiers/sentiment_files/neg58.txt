E3 2009 will be the first time I will not get to see G4TV's E3 coverage since Comcast moved the  G4 channel from basic cable to premium

E3 looks awsome this year i missed microsofts keynote though  damn!
E3 was alot better then last year, Now it's time for me to study  less gaming for now until I pass this math compass exam.
E3, are you ready? I'm not
