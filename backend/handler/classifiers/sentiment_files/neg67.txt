@DocPop you linked to an unpublished wordpress post so we cant see it 
@DocShaner Geez, you have an awesome studio space.  I have a masonite board I set on my lap when drawing. I've a page drawn standing up. 
@docstar42 The DS Lite I got recently turned out to be a dud  so I kinda have no choice. It looks so... mattey
@DocSteph It seems like any time Emma spends time with me, she gets sick   Tell her I hope she's feeling better.
@docstrange No, I do not actually  This was a theoretical plan before said friend went away for a month, but never came to fruition.
@DoctaCosmic i read your message way too late we ended up in West but decided to go home after getting all dressed up 
@Doctor_Donna A void crosser, I think. The Time Lord High Council used to be able to do it before the Time War. That knowledge was lost. 
@doctor_s There's no Wawa and 7-11s in Raleigh.  The closest thing we have here is Sheetz, but non conveniently located for  me.
