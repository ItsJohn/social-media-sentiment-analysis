Google App Engine corrupted my indexes again  Doesn't help versioning. All user data is gone until I get to rebuild the indexes again
Google AppEngine doesn't support JAXB or RESTEasy Client (no Sockets allowed).  No Service Bus on the Cloud 
Google Apps is down - and ours is Enterprise edition 
Google beat me to my web project  they are releasing Google Wave 
Google Chrome for MacOSX still unreliable http://bit.ly/E0eSQ + Wave accounts not available =&gt;putting off Google Apps usage for now 
Google Chrome only works on Intel Macs 
Google contacts on Pre. Problem is that it imports all contacts while the iphone just imports 1 folder 'my contacts'. Have to clean'em up 
Google Earth got me bored...    What can I do with it?
Google Earth just updates some landscape images of Vietnam, but not those of Danang

Google video chat won't work on Windows Vista/7 x64 
google wave will allow others to tag your messages, this will not help me with my Inbox 15,328 (and counting) strategy? 
Google Wave...yet another communication system. Before long, no one will leave their computers. No more back door neighbors I guess. 
Google Web History has failed me. There was this awesome WP tutorial I was looking at but I can't find it! I know I found it yesterday... 
Google, my employer, doesn't allow me to release my developed-in-my-free-time Android application unless I open source it.  Oh well.
