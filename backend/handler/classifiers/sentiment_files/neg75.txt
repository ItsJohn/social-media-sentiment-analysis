@helentaustin Aww, sorry to hear this  Thanks re: C. You take care of yourself, hope work will not be too bad, hugs xo
@helenthornber  nice pics, what you lack in quantity you make up for in quality - im failing on both counts 
@helenthornber I dunno but I used to get fruitsalads and blackjacks from the post office...we never got applejacks tho 
@helenthornber Just as well, otherwise it'd just give me even more reason to grump about all over the place! Sonic makes me feel old too 
@helenthornber wish I was going food shopping with my sis - she lives too far away for that  I'm still in my dressing gown lol
@HelenWayte Might get a few bob for the tent, not so sure about the kids the way they've been behaving lately.

@helga_hansen I think laughing is the better option when possible 
@helga_hansen I'm painting today just as yesterday.  Very enjoyable. But I've just finished my last digestive. 
@helga_hansen Yes, it's a tricky one. I guess it'd be easier if you had the website up and running so at least you could sell there
