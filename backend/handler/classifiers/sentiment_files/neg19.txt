@JasonBelne Thursday.....and straight back into the office 
@jasonboche experts exchange is slime and rarely has a solution

@jasonboche - not sure. not chatted to Carl recently. Have you tried the beta. Tried creating an OVF with vCenter4. but it honks. 
@JasonBradbury Annoying - Ch5 on my SKY box is the only channel from 100s with picture break-up and dodgy audio, like lack of signal 
@JasonBradbury As long as they don't phase out the controller then everything will be fine =D Too much of a good thing makes people fat 
@JasonBradbury i missed tonights episode  byt i think it wus set to record...
@JasonBradbury I'd sort it for you Jason, that's my job, sadly your out of my usual callout area 
@JasonBradbury I'm consumed with jealousy, but i refuse to pay more than Â£100 for an upgrade
