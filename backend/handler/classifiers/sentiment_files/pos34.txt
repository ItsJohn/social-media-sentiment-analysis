@LostCasanova I do, but it's only accessible by casting directors &amp; agents with breakdown accounts... noreevictoria.com is in the works 
@lostcheerio Absolutely lovely, both your kids' posts. I'm sure you're enjoying a wonderful Mother's Day. 
@LostCloset I know the feeling.  I just spent loads on supplies...now I need some sales 
@LostDeeJay 0k.. take care ...C u later 
@LostDeeJay BBT-wise, I'm about halfway through S1, and so far it's good. You have to appreciate geek/nerd humour though 
@LostDeeJay whoa - horse - cowboy - whip - kinky
