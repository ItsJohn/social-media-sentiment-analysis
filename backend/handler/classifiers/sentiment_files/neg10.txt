@brampitoyo Just realized we're in the same time slot tomorrow 
@brampitoyo Oh god.. That's the worst time to have one, too 
@bramstadhouders It's easier to feel connected through mutual pain. It's closer to the general level of consciousness of most people..

@davelaw00 Where were the live updates? 
@davelharrison I didn't think I'd anger the gods enough for them to inflict qmail on me... 
@Davemarriott Yup  But the update enables bluetooth and a lot of other features, so it's worth it imo.
@davemidd doesn't work for me across the board. Only I'm certain apps. And not tweetdeck. 
@davemidell_IFD dude i love forensic files!  All @sn3ph3rz and i watch is that or &quot;snapped&quot;...such nerds we are

@BrandonJhon something we all need sometime 
@brandonleblanc Yeah I know, my frustration is at the EU not at you or MSFT. Far more serious issues in the world than bundling a browser 
@brandonleblanc Zune software is okay, but when I play music with it, it doesn't count a a &quot;Play&quot; for the &quot;Social&quot; so I went back to WMP. 
@DavidArchie ohmygosh that is SO COOL your sis plays softball. I play it with my dad. Dang school doesn't offer it for me
