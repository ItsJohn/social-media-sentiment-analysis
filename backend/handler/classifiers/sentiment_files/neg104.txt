My little man is sick today, 
My little one had a nose bleed today 
my little one is gone for several weeks; woke up with the urge to check on him and he wasn't there 
my little one is not feeling so well, she's teething  awww. i feel so bad, i just held my baby til she went to sleep
my little search bar doesn't do anything 
My little sister is asleep and the kid's program is on tv, the most annoying melody in the world. and im too tired to turn it off... 
My little sister is microwaving popcorn. I love popcorn. I have braces. 
my little sister just got done telling me how much she hates me. i always knew she did, but i didn't know just how much she actually did.
