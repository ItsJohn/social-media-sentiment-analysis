@adammshankman Good night Adam. Sorry you had to see the ugly side of twitter    99% of the people are good, unfortunately, 1% can be mean
@adammshankman Hey Adam, you can't be permanent judge... then you'd never be able to choreograph  #sytycd
@adammshankman I don't know how follow Friday works either 
@adammshankman Love you on SYTYCD. Your choreography is great. Hope your broken heart is healing.   Much love from Jacksonville, FL.
@adammshankman Noooo!  You are my favorite judge!  
@adammurlewski damn that looks like fun! I'm still hanging about in the West Country when there's so much going on at home unfortunately 
@adammurlewski I guess, but still, a hint...it's unfair beyond belief  - I bet - nothing changes. It was meant to happen.

@adampiro   they said &quot;HR users needed the privacy&quot;. We said &quot;get access to our stuff and you have access to HR anyway&quot;.  We didn't win 
@adampiro sounds that way, although ipods aren't allowed for us either    working for a German organisation, everything is quite strict!
@adampiro we went to duals &quot;as compensation&quot; for having to sit out in the open area with all the other folks. No IT hidey-hole for us  
@adampolselli thanks skappy!  miss u so much! the vegas isn't the same without u 
@AdamPotts09 HMM...hope you liked the dinner I cooked for you!!...I can't sleep I have heartburn baby!

@adamread yes, it kept going off air  could not even ask a question nor get all what @jamesclay was explaining! #swrsc09
@adamriggins It does look cool. 10 bucks though. I'm not really a sports fan so doesn't seem worth it for me. Gonna get it? I want hulu 
@adamrowley &quot;The main difference appears to be an enhanced UI for the shopping cart screen. &quot; from TUAW. Nothing exiting 
@adamrowley No idea. Got the missus at home waiting for it 
@adamrucker It won't play! 
@adamrumbold But the rest of it was pretty depressing 
@adamrwaddingham I'm very good thanks. Yeah I'll probably campaign a bit unfortunately I've been an idiot &amp; registered my vote too late
