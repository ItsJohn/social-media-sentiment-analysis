@GordonHughes Excellent. WWDC is about more than Tech. First thing I do every year is check who's playing in SF. Struck gold with BfL 
@GordonHughes we saw a wee waterspout last year in the Baltic but I would like the thrill of seeing a Tornado. Safely 
@GordonKelly to be honest, before I got married my mum did stuff like that, she was worried I was offending people by taking no interest 
@GordonMJ I hope your feet feel better. At least you're not covered in garbage anymore.
