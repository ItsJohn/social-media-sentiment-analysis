I spent my free time over the last few days converting my server to 64bit, getting VT-x working etc just to get something to run. No Luck 
I spent SO MUCH money today   But it was all on stuff I need so I don't feel THAT bad.
I spent the last night in my house... getting some little things out and cleaning! We'll probably be here all day. Goodbye house!!! 
I spent the night waking up every two hours or so because the weather radio was going off telling me of the storms that I missed... 
I spent the weekend covered in adorable kittens. And in close proximity to their overflowing cat box. 
I spent the weekend partying and having a fun time...and now I have a buttload of schoolwork and I have to miss the mtv awards 
I spent three hours at the nails salon!!!!!
