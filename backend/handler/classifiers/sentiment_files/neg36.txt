@paranoidrdragon I know, but I saw the trailer and was suitably unimpressed. I think Telltale will ruin it, sadly 
@paranoidrdragon Optus is the most affordable but I can't say their coverage and quality of 3G is much good. Cause it stinks 
@paranoidvampire I wish I could lose myself in fanficland too  And I wanna catch up on your story, I still only read the first 2 chapters
@paranormalcolo Now that sounds good, but they close at 10 
@paranormalohio That show really was awesome.  I miss it sometimes. 
@paranormalspy Me too!! A lot of people in this field have dissappointed me lately  they are the reason this topic is not taken seriously.
@paranormalTV  on pins &amp; needles waiting for this, sad that its the season finale though    PRS u will be missed until next season!

@smartpen: great news, but I assume this doesn't apply to existing users?  I bought my smartpen only about a month ago.  
@smarx simpletracking.cloudapp.net vs simpletracking.com - 500-1500ms for azure, 80-100ms on a CELERON! Same code. Unacceptable 
@smaryka yes, it is...but only for a few miles. Patch work and random frost heaves reduces 1 lane to 1/4 lane. At 40mph. In rain.  
@Smash_Spaz are you ok? I feel bad
