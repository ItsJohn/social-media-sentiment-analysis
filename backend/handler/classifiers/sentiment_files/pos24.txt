@inkophile Yes, there's tons of beautiful ink I don't own, but I love the innovative Noodler's inks (and the relative permanence)! 
@inkrediblenyc hey Lonnie! I'll be there next weekend  I can't wait.
@inkscar I could cook you something. You might not recover from that. I've been told that my grilled fish is &quot;to die for&quot; and several do.
