@alanjlee I was thinking of warning @ozdj to avoid the toothpaste he put on that pancake... 
@alanjlee Not happy to say in public: it's too good a place to badmouth it. I'm sure it was just a bad weekend for staffing. 
@AlanKwanWaiMing  welcome to the lala land of twittering. get the hang out of it in no time
