@johncmayer Bahahhaa. I want that dog! 
@johncmayer congratulations!

@johncmayer I gotta admit, I was pretty blown away. You are a very talented man, John. Not that you need the ego boost or anything. 
@johncmayer I have never experienced such a thing. I have lived a very sheltered life 
@johncmayer I like that u know how/when to use &quot;sic,&quot; and that u put punctuation inside the quotation marks. Oh, and I like ur music, too
