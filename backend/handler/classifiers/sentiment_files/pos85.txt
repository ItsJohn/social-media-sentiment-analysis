God to hear Horrillo is out of the medically induced coma, can be spoken to and can move arms and legs  Speedy recovery to him please
God will make a way, when there seems to be no way. 
God will only do the part u cant do! If you focus on the natural God will focus on the Supernatural..  God gave u two hand 4 a reason..  
God without you is God,but you without god are nothing!! 
God works mysteriously!i learn that if u think of the world wonderfully you will receive more &amp; get what u ask for 
god! for some reason I was in the mood for pizza rolls and a beer.. and I had that 
God, I hope that I have fun tomorrow. I have a slight case of boredomitis right now. LOL 
God, I love him. He really is an amazing guy. 
God, I really can't get enough of this 'Battlefield' song. I could listen to it all day 
God, I'm really mad about the sound of my recordings! It's killing my ears, but hey... You need to start off somewhere 
God, that was difficult. I validated though. Well, all but 2 pages which I know why but can't do anything really. Well done me. 
God, you paint the sky real real good. I want you to teach me to paint kinda like you do. 
God. Had a party yesterday. Gonna have a Pool Party today+a Family Reunion so its a Pool Family Reunion Party 
Godawful hangover today. Worth it tho

godmorning sunshine! yey, now rain today!

GODs been good to me... even when i've been drifting.. hHe always finds a way to say He loves me 
God's so glorious that He opened the heavens hearing our cries and so blessed to join the Joint Service of CSB Rizal branches.

@eddieifft You don't want to leave because secretly you know Australia is twenty times better than America! 
@eddieizzard    Alma Mater is derived from the motto Alma Mater Studiorum (meaning &quot;Nourishing Mother of Studies&quot;), apparantly 
@eddieizzard And the weather is also lovely in Leicester Eddie 
@eddieizzard And we Americans tell everyone else to learn English. 
@eddieizzard Don't know about LA, but it's lovely here 
@eddieizzard I'm watching 40. It's compelling!! 
@eddieizzard Johannesburg, is lovely, we have sunshine and just enough cloud to ensure its not too hot! Awsome! tnx 4 asking 
@eddieizzard Morning Mr Izzard, yes but why 'pants' ? why not hat ? we rely on you to find these things out  *ribbet*
@eddieizzard PS. weather is almost always beautiful sunshine here !! 
@eddieizzard The weather in torrevieja, spain is beautiful  too hot to sleep properly at night.
@eddieizzard Why the obsession with the weather? Something very English about it, for someone who's European first 
@eddieizzard You wouldn't happen to still be in NYC doing gigs on Friday or Saturday next week? 
@eddiekemp my plans . . . tweet as much as possible to build my twitpire 
@EDDIEKLIVE Same to you!
