BUT CAPITAL SUMMER BALL NEXT WEEK 
but che said to me &quot;move on but don't keep away&quot; haha... thanks che. 
But dang.... I am SORE now. Best game of our season, hands down 
But debate like this is what heats me up!  My view can be summarize as follows: Science is NOT settled. (Yet?)
but dont s top following me 
but ending the day with red wine is even better. 
but enjoying the day with a drink    and it's sunny but cool outside
but first i have to go to the 'Jumbo' to see Gioiaa while she's working xD but she'll take a break with me  Milkshakes!&lt;3
But fleetwood mac will always have wonderful memories for me 
But for some reason, KN makes me feel like trying non-franchise places more! 
but fuck it, i've already booked green day tickets on her credit card.......na na na na naaaaaaa!!! 
but God is faithful and i'm eternally grateful 
But goodmorning twitter 
but i am looking forward to urinetown and a night in by myself 
But I am on pg 145 of 165, so I'm getting close!  *yawn*
but i am one happy girl right now.   
But I am so feeling the #FF love right now 
But I do want to call attention to AimeeLady's new name! It's WAY to AWESOME to overlook! She is now @Queen_of_Tarts! Just too awesome. 
but I don't talk; just working the board 
But I gots my coffee and ewww someone just farted next to me! Wtf! That's gross! I see you @goodbyekat  lol
But I gotta be optimistic, at least they came to Argentina and thats a dream come true even when I cant be there 
But I had fun too! Those people are good company! 
but I have to get up in a min as we are going out ... to the cinema to see Terminator ... I'm looking forward to it 
But i hope it will make sense in the movie. 
But I know this is also really hard for Varsity Fanclub. I support u guys and your awesome if you need someone to talk to I'm right here. 
but i learnd from you â™¥* thnkz 
but I love them still... 
but I met Lula and I LOVE HER!!! Fierce  xo
But i passed my neuro exam. 
But I still feel like a kid with an awesome present.  Walking around my home with  ultra-light computer, online. Will Skype family now.  
but i still luuuuuuurrrrvvveee you!!! haha! 
but i think i deserve a little shopping fun - it should help make things all better 
But I will follow 
but I WOULD trade it in for a better car.  01 civic anyone?? HOLLA.
but if it keeps you around, then im down 
but if y'all really gonna #unfollowdiddy, atleast follow me to fill the void! 
But if you aren't with your fam, tweet on 
but if your think bout my baby it dont matter if ur black or white 
but I'm kinda in the writing mood...  
but im not complaining. 
But im pressing forward thanks to my mommy giving me a grand speech it really helped me put things in order  -musiic[BOX]
But I'm still expecting that good ok sunshine today  just bc it's beautiful...
but it rocks. it really, really, rocks  i think i feel really sorry for the cylons, which is probably a trap!
but it should be worth it when they are straight 
But its all good, hope my seat is good and I can get some amazing pics! 
but it's all worth it because of you @JessicaPinup 
BUT ITS GETTING WARM OUTSIDE, SO I HAVE TO GET MY BLACK ASS WORKING OUT AGAIN  WANNA WORK OUT 2GETHER?
but it's okay 
but it's working fine now ... and my last tweet had 4 #hash tags ... prolly the maximum I have evr used 
But June 6 is not going to be anywhere near as glorious as August 15. Woot woot. 
But let patience have her perfect work,that U may B perfect&amp;entire,wanting nothing~Jame 1:4 TYJesus! 
But let's start with breakfast 
But maybe thats never. Never say never!   I really should start this :\
but most of all I'm chilling with  Amanda Lynn !!!!!!!!!! 
but my sight is better tonight so i might see you in my nightmare.... well how did you get there? i love lil wayne 
but my son brought me flowers... and the day was saved 
but new stuff comes out in about a month hope you like it 
But not hard enough. Try going to grantbourque.m7k.org on your iPhone. 
but not on a bbq nor outside b&amp;q but inside, away out of the heat and ultra violet rays, possibly washed down by an icy coca cola 
But not quite 1:1 with the 20,622 balloons in Up.  re: http://ff.im/3pTKp
but not yet.  @TribeHelp hey, what chance we could go a WEEK w/out major outages? I'd like to keep the few friends still left on tribe.. 
But now I can drive home!  Hope the weather is fine up there!
But now tht were not best friends its easier to agree with people when they say hes gorgeous  hhhahah
But of course. I have better things to do. People to see. And trips to plan 
but ok..fa real fa real GOODNIGHT!  may talk to yall tomorrow if im not at bahama beach w/ the homies
But on the real im out . . Peace yall 
but only 1 &quot;Father.&quot;  
But overall, putting my pickyness of writing style aside... I thought it was great 
but probably staying at the venetian @ macau was the highlight- felt like royalty. gold all the way babe.  ate too much yummy chinese food
but roberta or whatev is hotter and stuff :p  Doctorrrrr who tonight 
But ruh roh....hotel pool is outside.  Whoops!!  Sounds like we'll have movie night instead.  Not so bad   Weather 80 &amp; sun tomorrow yay!
But seriously, the sneak peak for New Moon was really good. 
but she really is my best friend, and I miss her all ready. I know my family will do well 
But Skins' begging me to watch it... Skins it is 
but SOON!!  alright 'night
But Spanish restaurant was nice and we had a nice dessert there instead 
But thank Goodness it's not so serious... 
but thanks to this i slept with mum and she cuddled me all night long 
but that's not all, that's definitely not all 
but the film is very thrilling. or am i only impressed by the actor? maybe... he's so hot! 
but the NBA draft is on the 25th! ; whooot blake g. # 1 pickkk..  @Crystal0915 @CMason48
But the trip was well worth it! 
but then  i have to go to gym and i really hate it haha well goodnight! 
But then again...Melbourne will always be here... 
But there is something to look forward to! Only two freaking weeks of school left. Hell yeah!  I can't wait for summer - bring it on! (:
But they gave me a seedless bread, so its all good 
But we too embarrased to ask  first time kev has not had brown sauce on his sausage. He mad for the stuff.
BUT well done to diversity 
But were both off tomorrow 
but what's keeping me alive is God, i can't imagine my life without Him. 
But when you think Tim McGraw....Ahhhh, @TaylorSwift13, you're amazing 
But while I was watching the movie I realized I know too much details about the original saga. Cool. 
But why would it matter for your opinion? No pictures of noah that night  +Junoir D+
but without you all im going to be is....incooommmpllleeettee. Oh Rhett 
But yall know &quot;I ain't have sex in a long timeee, all we have is sex tonight&quot;  hehe
But you have to remember that they haven't even really started post preduction yet. 
But you know I stay positive.. 
but you're just a boy. 
But yup. Shaved. It's nice. 
But, honestly, who cares.  I still love Leighton, NO MATTER WHAAT. 
BUT, I get to go get my facial soon &amp; then get some new boulder holders for these JJ's, so, it's gonna be a good day.  
But, I listen to Jack Johnson and work and it is calmin' me down 
But, twitter fail aside, if summer break means more Delhi days like today, I think summer will make me happy  http://tinyurl.com/kw8kem
but.. i admit; it's fun to update. haha. even if there is nobody that sees it 
But.. There is hope .. Tomorrow i'm going to Germany.  to a nice landhouse.
but... im still in love with him!!! 
But: @TorontoEats Coffee habit strong, not confident I'd withstand + cookie reminders  Sharing DR food tweets already us makes hungry

Also, two of my best friends are on here as characters for my Sim to meet: Jake and Johnny (@Azizco910) 
Also, we had a movie night (last Friday). Those who came got a free movie pass to the upcoming release of &quot;Year One.&quot; See you there guys! 
Also, while onstage, receiving my diploma, I was told, ' it's like a tweetup. Are you twittering this?'  It made my day

Although that could be really funny in a &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot; kind of way. 
although tonight wasn't as promising as i thought it would be, still a great day 
Although Wolverine wasn't a great movie, I don't think it was as bad as everyone is saying...&amp; at least Taylor Kitsch was in it 
although, DON'T KNOW THE RESULT! (Don't watch sports news as I'm a girl yaknow  I hope Hatton got at least a few worthwhile punches in
Although, if I am seriously going to stay up over 2 hours more to watch &quot;Milk&quot; maybe I should grab some things to eat, hmm...  
Altogether, things are good.
