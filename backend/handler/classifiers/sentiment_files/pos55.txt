@szilveszter the later one is not an issue. Programming always needs a big screen (or two).  (Btw using now the same.)
@szinck Get a new theme for it, or use the 'Groundwork' that's built on top of it -- prettier.  But easier, nah!
@szl Dave made that?  WOW!  I'm impressed!  
@Sznq They drink rum, but they eat bullets.  I'm thinking you should stay you.

@tonymarkx Such a dear  After being awoken way too early (1am) was a rocky start but turned out good anyway 
@TonyMast Absolutely, I promise to stop lurking.    Sounds like one of the steps to recovery.
@TonyMast And once you get rich and famous, I can say, I knew him from the start and I helped with the pressure. 
@TonyMast Thanks for the shout-out!  Too bad Discovery seemed to bag on YouSpoof 2.0. I think MvC could have won.
