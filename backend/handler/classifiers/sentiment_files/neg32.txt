@mr_billiam i'm just glad i found out now- would hate to have dragged myself around infecting people 
@mr_billiam I've been trying for weeks to update my background   I'll have another go soon then
@mr_billiam LOL-good luck-only reason I have receptiom at home is that I know guy that used to throw the darts - he's finished now though 
@mr_billiam no idea .. it's not going to be done properly - they wanted me to make it my &quot;baby&quot; .. my baby is going to be premature now 
@mr_billiam no I'm sorry - having a slight Twitter stalker issue  it's always some dick that spoils the fun
