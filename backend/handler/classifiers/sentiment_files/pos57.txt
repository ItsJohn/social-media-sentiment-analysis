@Scobleizer Friendfeed asks for TMFI. That's probably the real reason any rational person would dislike it. And prob even Mike Arrington. 
@Scobleizer -so does a more comprehensive service or technology win or better &quot;marketing,&quot; pr and distribution win? 
@scoccaro It's certainly different    So what's the source of the cinnamon?

@WoollyMittens There's serious media and not so serious media. I think @the_rooster is watching Channel Nine. Factual/Rational it isn't. 
@WoollyMittens Virgin is recommended, although I have only been in the back once. The very front is fantastic!  Stop over in HK too.

@thinknuts well done @sgsabbage 
@ThinkReferals I think they should start a celebrity Twitter.  Then they could leave regular Twitter to the regular guy!...any thoughts?  
@ThinkReferrals I would say much less then 50/50 
@ThinkReferrals Oh i've got some friends in STl who wouldn't be too happy about that! I'm staying neutral and will support you both 
@ThinkReferrals oh man I'm jealous!  just got it?
@ThinkReferrals probably that would be better answered by browsing #IranElection &amp; drawing your own conclusions. 
@ThinkReferrals whew! feel relieved!  meanness, try to avoid it! how is your day thus far? LMAO
@thinman yeahhhhh mate  Let us know how the rebuild goes. Are you going to blog the pains and pleasures?
