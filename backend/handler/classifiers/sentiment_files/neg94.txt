July is gonna suck. I can just feel it. 
Jump start fail.  AAA to the rescue!

June 1, 3-cars short on NJTransit and a long standing ride   Boo!
June 17/06/09.... yet no OS 3.0 for my iPhone 
June 1st and we have a new house, the girls are graduating.  The MEETING was painless but still awful.  And, am thinking I need a new job 
june 21st is in four days and it's cold. 
June gloom, I thought you were gone.  ... I guess that means it's time to head to the gym.
June is going to be a long, lonely month. 
June must be the worst month EVER. And to make it even worse, weird stuff is happening  HATE IT!
Junior soccer *not* canceled 
junk food and movies in a tshirt and sweats.... the only way tonight would be better is if I had someone to hang with
