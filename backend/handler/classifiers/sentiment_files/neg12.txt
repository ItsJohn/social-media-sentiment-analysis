@dragonflyeyes IDK, but I wish it'd stop being broken.  What else am I supposed to do besides stalk my F-List?!
@dragonflyeyes There is no justice.  I would personally have him serve the rest of his life in jail. The justice system is a sham.
@Dragonhold nah, need to see a doc and get them to sort my throat out I think.  
@Dragoninja I understand how you feel. Misplacing money is an absolutely infuriating feeling.

@Dragontamerno3 What is SuWriMo and why have I not heard of it before? And I can't find it on google 
@dragontart Yes,he is. It's just that ppl like her get to me &amp; I lose my temper. It's harrassment, plain &amp; simple using the guilt trip. 
@Dramathan o and the mystery band song comes with a special mystery photo yezzzzzir!  k gotta go 2 bed now
