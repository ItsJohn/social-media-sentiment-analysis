@Itxi_Itx @th3maw  Clutching sheets and laughing.  Now *that's* my kinda thing.  
@Itxi_Itx actually I think it's kind of like mumbling to yourself in the supermarket! lots of people  trying hard to ignore you 
@Itxi_Itx Actually left the book behind :o and took my ipod much harder to see when you listen to audiobooks - but didn't had great fun 
@Itxi_Itx awakened indeed - thought some twitter alarm clock had gone off that I missed 
@Itxi_Itx Damn you analysts! *shakes fist* Well, at least my spontaneous reply contains a grain of truth, at the very least... 
@Itxi_Itx Excellent choice!
