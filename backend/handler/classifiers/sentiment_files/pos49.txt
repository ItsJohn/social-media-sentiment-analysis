@shanselman Hmmm ... mine. Will investigate. You saw the &quot;alpha&quot; tag, right? 
@shanselman http://twitpic.com/4j30t - Looking good, but I still think that looks like a lot of holes!  
@shanselman I'm happy to see that you're able to continue searching for yourself via Chrome and Bing 
@shanselman Is part 8 convincing the better half to allow it into the house? Would be the most impressive bit 
@shanselman it even managed to stop Vista freaking out about activation somehow 
@shanselman live search already had that infinite image search feature. it's not new 
@shanselman they must come from round my way. 
@shanselman when Mesh syncs a delete, the deleted files are moved to the Recycle Bin. found this out the (almost) hard way. 
@Shanses Goodnight!&lt;33 
@shansgrl  I know. But I think I can take her
