@Butterflyshoes yep - rubbish. really rubbish.  like back to how I was 4 months ago   Cool. What do you do again?
@butterflysnbees but we know the +'s. Shaming your friends doesn't earn points w/ them. there's just a big anti-bfing culture out there. 
@butterflywheel @aliving Your package is still not in the mail. I cannot get Al to help me get it together 
@BUTTERFLYWHEEL doesn't ring a bell Monica, sorry 
@BUTTERFLYWHEEL Just 2 or 3 days with priority mail...  no it is not sent...
@butterflyylost had an epiphany re: 'love life' while reading a book on programming. Save for moments w/ peeps + job, life = shambles. 
@butterpecan412  I do it when I dont want to go to my friends house, it makes me feel like a bad person 
@ButtersGold sorry i just got home from being out all day. any night that ends at ray's pizza is a great night. macau called, no phone 
@Button84 aw dayum  I say tell em to kick rocks w/ his socks &amp; shoes off...or..stick his head in a bucket of water &amp; breathe...DEEP! Lol

@buzzamus We are sick together woop woop... except my cold is basically going away thanks to sudafed but my dizziness is still there 
@buzzbishop No direct experience w/a cracked iPhone screen. My guess tho? They're probably gonna make you buy a new one. 
@buzzflash I am partial to &quot;Dicky Dearest&quot; but sadly I am in last place. 
@Buzznet probably won't appreciate my opinions on that survey for the new Beta photo pages. Pretty much hated them. 
@BuZZrk most of my weekend was spent sickly,  on a lighter note this weekend is the start of a great summer. how was yours?
@BuzzyBas yo bro...@nkotb has cancelled Oz tour  chek it dot @nkotb.com

@bwexxx  i hope you hoes are having so much fun...not TOO much without me though lol
@bwharrison That's great! Exercise helps to clear my mind from all the clutter. I don't like going to a gym  I prefer the outdoors.
@Deltahick rad! Its been raining nonstop here- at least you don't hafta work like I do 
@Deltalynn thanks!!! I'm tired of short tho... Growing it back out again... There's no pleasing me 
@Deltanimal hehe, i'll try to... but that's just my schedule...  i have to get use to it again, kinda difficult after 3 weeks. :-s
@Deltavogue  A lot of ppl have never opened themselves emotionally to a pet to appreciate just how deep our relationships w/them can be. 
@Deltavogue I'm so sorry to hear that.
