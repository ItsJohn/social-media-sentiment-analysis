@JoelMadden  are there actually people awake on your end of twitterville? I got you, @petewentz and @MCBFF the rest of the world is out. 
@JoelMadden Aw! Marley and Me. Such a sad movie 
@JoelMadden awesome!! It doesn't come to Dallas until the 24th I believe... 
@JoelMadden awh  that was a good movie though &lt;3
@JoelMadden Darn I wont be in Vegas until Saturday!! 
@JoelMadden hell yeah the movie was sad... but thats exactly what made me break down, the thought of my baby dog dying 
@JoelMadden I am really jealous you got to see them  I wish i could see them tomorrow.
@JoelMadden I have a life sized poster of you on my wall staring at me. I enjoy it. I also have 7 others that are not life sized 
@JoelMadden I love that movie!!!  Very cute &amp; yes sad!!  
@JoelMadden i never feel earthquakes either..one time i was in bel air and there was a huge one like 7 on the richter and i didnt feel it 
@JoelMadden I soo wanted to see that movie because I love Jennifer Aniston, but I refuse to watch it because I know he dies 
@JoelMadden I thought this too but its an awful thought, mum says no more dogs after this, the end of their life is too hearbreaking

@Hebbie Nice - that's a great view! Much nicer to hear (&amp; see) the water tho. We're on a back B road that goes to Dunscore, so cars  
@hebrewzzi One thing I hate about CA: No DD.  (I dig the coffee.)
@hebyo im on my phone and not allowed on computer

@JoelMadden i wish that would change something for me 
@JoelMadden My puppy died two weeks ago, I was going to see Marley &amp; Me with my mum but I don't think we will now. Damn life 
@JoelMadden seriously.  what a mockery!  i watched most of it and will never get those minutes back 
@JoelMadden So scary!!! My heart stoped few second 
@JoelMadden watched that movie on the plane ride to NY and I got all teary eye'd  sad movie...good, but sad.
@JoelMadden what was that prob joel
