Angel and Demons is a pretty darn good movie for a book adaptation 
Angel is lame for having a twitter and he sucks for not liking harry potter. Love his best friend  &lt;Hurrm...&gt;
Angel`s section 2. She`s asking, who else is with her? 
Angels &amp; Demons = Major Awesomeness!! 
Angels &amp; Demons not as good as the book and knowing the ending didn't help.  But LOVED it all the same.  Ewan McGregor is yummmmmm 
angels &amp; demons starts playin' tomorrow!! 
Angels &amp; Demons was pretty good. Train ride back to Queens. 
Angels &amp; Demons was pretty thrilling! I liked it more than The Da Vinci Code, definitely going to read both of the books  Even better!
Angels &amp; Demons, a story about Illuminati conspiracies and the Catholic Church... My verdict is, Ewan McGregor = squee! 
Angels and Demons is an excellent movie  Tom Hanks is superb.
Angels and Demons was a great movie. 
Angels and Demons was great  But I don't get the connection with Tom Hanks and a speedo??
Angels And Demon's was incredible... A worth while viewing! 
ANGELS AND DEMONS WAS PRETTY GOOD!  yooh should go watch it! I actually kind of like movies that make yooh think x] ROFL.
angels and demons was really awesome! 
Angels n Demons was nice.... Now for uh...sleep 
angging! nicole!pa-upload ng pics from yesterday  http://plurk.com/p/rlanf
Angles and Demons is like the adult national treasure with the pope involved. I LOVE clue movies  Go pay Tom Hanks and see it! It's fun!
