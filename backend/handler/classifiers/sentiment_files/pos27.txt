@johncmayer in the process of doing so 
@johncmayer It kind of averages out on a weighted scale does it not? Only with the great option you blow your wad all in one shot.

@johncmayer Like there was ever any doubt you wouldn't.. Way to go 
@johncmayer loved the children's choir together with your great playing 
@johncmayer maybe you just think you feel that way because you have already been &quot;great&quot;. 
@johncmayer ooooh, that's gotta make you proud! 
@johncmayer Probably yes, because sheï¿½ll be your wife, not your mom...  Just in case, enjoy your breakfast !
@johncmayer sounds like a good lonely.. might just do the same.. 
@johncmayer Tabasco cures all even loneliness 
@johncmayer Take a posh and erudite book and read it while eating, nodding occasionally.  Seriously ups the cred points. 
@johncmayer 'tastes like lonely'. Aww that is sad and strangely familiar. Red wine and a hot pocket is my kind of lonely. Ha good times 
@johncmayer that applies to other things in life as well 
@johncmayer that was an easy decision 
@johncmayer then have a steak, salad, and wine...sounds like something worth sharing. 
@johncmayer toooo funny

@jonathanscary Why not a pair of Barefoot MM27s instead?  Fraction of the price and unbelievable translation (www.barefootsound.com) 
@jonathansutton hahahaha... that's the funniest thing ever. bek's always been the mom of the group. 
@jonathanw Yes the receiver is 0.5cm big ex. the USB, it doesn't do the  laptop lid feature but I think that feature is a bit lame

@JonBouman Twitter is more like a symptom, than a platform.  The disease is the one that is killing the traditional advertising model. 
@jonbradbury Just realised I need to do a bit of washing-up 
@jonbro i was just looking at the free mp3's on last.fm &amp; i saw a bunch of handface tracks. nice
