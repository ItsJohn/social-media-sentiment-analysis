Happiness is knowing within me I have the power to handle anything that ever happens to me 
Happiness is knowing your daughter prefers her guitar, Aesop's Fables and soy milk to TV, grunge music and soda. 
Happiness is like peeing your pants...nobody can see it but only you can feel it's warm sensation 
Happiness is... an empty inbox.... e.g. all e-mails dealt with or filed
