@problogger And now you've made me hungry for chocolate too 
@problogger another quick Q - will the email part of 31dbbb always be available?  And thanks for the responses to my other questions!
@problogger been there, not the writhing on the floor and squealing though 
@problogger david beckham wasnï¿½t aware that he was in that chinese herbal viagra commercial either. Beware. 
@problogger it had an impact though, including in a few ways you never heard about. 
@problogger Its support for multiple accounts is one reason I'm a fan of Tweetie on my iPhone. Love tools that help me tweet my way. 
@problogger LOL nooooo if I am this far behind now, I would still be working on 60DBBB next year  But seriously been loving it!!
@problogger LOL! indeed its a funny movie. I've seen that movie twice myself 
@problogger read that article. The mechanics of a Retweet begin with the word &quot;please&quot; 
@problogger so how's it all going, do you have the w/e off? Friday is movie night at ours... kids, popcorn, cosy slippers, life is sweet 
@problogger thats nice to hear .. hope she does not reply to ur questions via blog posts 
@problogger You can beam over to California and it will be 2:10 in the afternoon. 
@ProBurn  Awesome! I totally agree, you don't need the remixes to do that either! Looking forward already to any new material!
