@teresafuhl regret? because I can only speak through post-its, apparently. The lump in my throat was so big i couldn't say much else. 
@teresajohns much to my dismay, prob never 
@TeresaKopec Ahhh, that makes sense - if the Tivo isn't HD it probably wouldn't hook up correctly. 
@TeresaKopec I went to NY once and asked what kind of coke they had..they looked at me like I was crazy 
@TeresaKopec on one being meaner. not true at all. I think its equal and depends on what's going on. unfortunately,women r easier targets 
@TeresaMedeiros I'm sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned it. 
@Teri_Fied aww sucks 
@Teri_Fied I never win shit. I won a bunch od CDs once for answering a weird question. But, never picked 'em up. 
@Teri_Fied Yeah, she had to go.

@sujaiantony hmm.. becoz i am new to it... i dont hate it... but i still love C++ 
@sujal great link, that qualifies as interesting.  Not sure what's worse, the story or that I'm not surprised 
@sujayendra Oh nice.. Yep me too took off this weekend. good no sports now... It makes me feel like a loser this year 
@sujayendra Work man 
@SukaAndSpice no not really Im already on senior level, like Im the boss after the designer. Small company. Its just not creative enough 
@SukebeUchujin no cute girl asks me out for the weekend  so I also hate my job ;)
@Sukess I have 9, the A one. Did 8 is January, so so so hard. 
@suki  Bummed that I didn't get to meet you last night ( We MUST next opportunity!!
@suki I hate when people whose movies I admire go and try to do books which I have read many many times. 
@suki oh, likewise. but i've got mental pictures of all of carroll's books from reading them for so many years. and that makes it harder. 
@SukieBunny not the lurgy? 
@SukieBunny thanks for the tip, but none in this neck of the woods 
@SukiFuller Did they leave me out on purpose! 
@sukitgood WTF. I wanna go. 
@sullenxsunshine rub it in why dont you 
@Sullivan_Smith oh no doubt, discovery is part of the process and fun, but certain things are universally baseline, and getting muddled 
@sullivancc14 haha I really don't but I'm going to this workshop at school next week. Are you going? Plus my car is broken right now 
@tiaralynn I wish as well. Hard to say. The margin is very close these few days.
