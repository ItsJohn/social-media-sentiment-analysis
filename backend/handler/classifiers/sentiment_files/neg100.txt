Many people don't realise that mentors have bad days too 
many people know me. but very few understand me   emo daw.. hehe http://plurk.com/p/125fep
Many people who complain are also those who don't vote or take any other actions. 
Many shows I like are being picked up for another season, while shows I dislike aren't. Alas, the Summer Glau Chronicles are dead 
Many, many thanks to @baketastic for the cupcakes. One cotton candy one all gone! Will have to wait til later to try the others.
