@Alska @Andrea__P If I wasn't struggling to get my meds refilled I'd definitely be buying from you both. Disability doesn't pay me much.

@alsoekim it stopped raining, and the sun came out, so i rode to the plaza in just a t-shirt... was bucketing down on the way home

@ArsenalSarah I'll be out there tomorrow! Catching up on indoor stuff today! 
@alvarlux @feedabah note that he has the Korg MicroKorg, same synth I've used for ages   And Roland Fantom-X6. Neither are plugged in.
@alvarlux it was so freaking hot in the bakery today   I melted
@AlvinYeh I have the now defunct iPhone 3G  I can type pretty quickly though - just learn to trust the autocorrect! What're you up to now?

@alyankovic I like that your new profile pic is less pimptastic, but @ludovicah has a point with it not being a recent picture 
@alyankovic Is there a lower quality version of that video? HD skips BADLY on my netbook

@autismfamily I stopped drinking dark soda earlier this week and was sipping sprite bc my tummy was yucky but drank some pepsi Friday 
@autismfamily I wish I could get my son in that!  But it's the wrong cost.  You have to go for it!
@autismmom07 I am in the same boat! We really want to heal Gabe's gut, but I feel like we keep having little set-backs here and there!   
@Autisticlemon Aw, Ryan why are you so pissed?
