@Dhympna I might just have to pick your brain in the future.  Right now I'm off to a Dr. appointment. (What fun!)
@Dhympna If it inspires analysis, that's a step in the right direction, seems to me.  Maybe &quot;eenie meanie&quot;...
@Dhympna just not a skill I developed, I guess. Now, if you want someone to throw you a football, or maybe sing a lullaby, I'm your guy. 
@Dhympna Link won't open, but I will try it when i have a better connection tomorrow. I'm curious now 
@Dhympna Sweetie, if you refuse to offend, who will?  We expect it -- nay, we count on it.
