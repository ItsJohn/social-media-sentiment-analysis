@scottfrye If the yaoi went away, there wouldn't be more of other manga, just... less yaoi. 
@scottgal Can I talk about any hermit, or were you specifically wanting us to talk about you as a hermit? 
@scottgal I think one either loves Seth Macfarlane or think he's the devil.  I'm in the former camp.

Sometimes a friend just needs a lil push 
Sometimes a little love makes all the bad things better. 
Sometimes a simple smile is enough to warm you heart and make your day- Hanna Angell 
Sometimes being helpful can bite one in the arse.  
Sometimes CNN comes up with some whopper poll questions...read my tweet below 
sometimes empathy is a beautiful thing but sometimes it eats up your soul. black absorbs everything but can give nothing back. but i'm ok 
sometimes i don't even understand how i am so giddy. drive-in was a success 
Sometimes I feel bad on Fridays. I have *SO MANY* good people to recommend, and it's hard to keep them organized. It's a good problem. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a dream. 
Sometimes i get mesmerized watching my tach and speedo rise in unison 
Sometimes I hate myself, but that's normal so I don't worry bout it 
sometimes I look at ur profile for a good laugh 
sometimes i love how cruel this world is.. because i get to fight back and get even 
sometimes i want to be like a professional cyclist, they seem to be resting a lot  @stevendejongh
sometimes I wish I was kelly bundy....but in the end I'm more like the lazy horny peggy bundy 
Sometimes I wonder if people would like me more if I was more active, or more social, or prettier...then I remember I don't care 
Sometimes I wonder me &amp; my daughter is mother-in-law &amp; daughter-in-law. We fight as if we are the worst MIL &amp; DIL. 
sometimes long calls are more than worth it in the end 
sometimes love comes around and it knocks yu down just get back up when it knocks yu down.. 
sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down 
sometimes my eyes glow.  like an angel.
sometimes people are strange 
sometimes simple things bring the most pleasure... like hammering through central London on a bike at midnight. lovely 
sunflowers and poppies are blooming 
sunglasses - check. radio 4 friday comedy podcasts- check. drive back to Winchester - check. Poop poop!!

sometimes six degrees is too close 
sometimes starting ur period can be the greatest thing to happen to you all month.... get me?    off 2 &quot;work&quot;   peaceofmind city slickers 
Sometimes the opportunity is inconveniently located... But since I'm going, I'll try too see all my friends in OC. 
sometimes the universe just doesn't want you to have falafel. when that happens, just order pizza 
Sometimes they day you where dreading turns out to a great one! 
Sometimes things do work in my favor 
sometimes things in life are just to hard to walk away from.........playing some music 
Sometimes those things are best especially with pets.  @johna404
Sometimes u just have to splurge on that fattening as hell iced mocha latte for a good morning pick me up...mmmmm 
sometimes you have to cheat and lie to win contests, but that is perfectly a-okay with me 
sometimes you'd have to choose...superstar or scholar  either way,you're playing both roles effortlessly georgeous... ENVY!ha-ha xx
Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy. 
Sometimes you're lucky, the AC adaptor from an old router I don't use fits the #QY70 
Sometimes, having a small car is great 
Sometimes, i like to kick the milk jug... I mean lick. 
sometimes, it is better to let go than hold on to. 
sometimes, like today, I simply stop and say, &quot;GOD! I have awesome parents! thanks for giving me to them.&quot;  gregory &amp; kathy, thank you.
Sometimes, ok, all the time, I love being a dad. 
Sometimes, the pack of reds you find lying on the side of the sidewalk is half full. 
Sometimes, there's nothing more relaxing than playing fetch with your dog 
sometimes, years doesnt mean anything...here's to no longer living with fake &quot;family&quot; 4 man army...1 captain...never again 
Sometimes...I really love my sister 
somewhat caught up in the office. hi twitter!! what did i miss?  ...besides... YOU?!
Somewheeeere over the rainbow... +tirili+ Good morning everybody  Be jealous! I'm a unicorn! Yaaay!
Somewhere between the hot and the cold.  Somewhere between the wrong and the right.  Somewhere in the middle you'll find me.  
Somewhere in the stratosphere 
somewhere, somehow, someone smiles at the thought of you.
