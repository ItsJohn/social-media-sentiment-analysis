@MajesticSEO Yes. But I've an issue with the verif file  I've sent an email to your support today.
@majic13 that is a lame plan - if it's Monday then i have to go to work today and won't be playing Mortals 
@majicDave - Nice graph. My games aren't doing quite as well sadly  . GumDrops lite is topping out at 30 downloads a day right now.
@major_C thank you... 
@majorh The twets I got from ppl in Pittsburgh last night point to this being particularly nasty. Bunch of flooding there. 
@majornelson  can you kick someone so I can try the 1 v 100 beta 
@majornelson @aceybongos I still can not download Rocket Riot (but the other two new arcade games released). I am located in Germany 
@majornelson Ahh Live don't bother me today. I got [PROTOTYPE] to play ^^. Sucks those guys out there can't play on Live though 
@majornelson Fry's in Manhattan Beach 20-30 min drive as well! Run Run! but too late they prolly closed now at 11pm 
@majornelson I am VERY Excited for the ZuneHD! I am jealous that select few will be given one in advance 
@majornelson i cant get into the game  its says that is full :'(
@majornelson My god.  Its... its glorious.  Teach the VP to speak publicly though.  No emotion 
@majornelson no divx-viewing from local drive for me tomorrow then 
@majornelson Oh man. It's so ridiciolous that we don't have Ghostbusters on Xbox here in Europe. 
@majornelson What about us guys who couldn't play for 16 Mos. and STILL can't play today? 
@majornelson Yeah, but I don't think I can read the Live Blog with my phone while I'm stuck at work 
@majornelson You are so lucky  Will they release them early for a public beta? Like with the NXE? That would be pretty cool.
@majornelson, why can't we get into the beta for 1 vs 100????  We downloaded it, we were there at 7:30... and yet it was too full... 
@MajorProblem  - hey got here safe - going back tonight - stoopid road drivingness  hope your having a wonderful weekend! 
@MajorProblem  That sounds so good. You are evil. Next time keep that info to yourself. Sigh...
