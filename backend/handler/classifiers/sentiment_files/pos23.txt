@Hooded bright sunshine here in sunny Surrey  have a good day
@Hooded Mines done that before, usually it works if you hold sleep and home button for a few seconds to reset it 
@Hooded Testing you.  If you look deeply enough at the philosophy behind it all you'll find that it says; &quot;Give to Tiger&quot;  on the back.  
@HoodenersHorse that's the beauty of ska! No dancing skills required, as long as they can sway and bob in time to the music! 
@HoodJTM  CONGRATS on the birth of your son ! I want a picture ASAP   and will have to come visit when you are ready ! !
