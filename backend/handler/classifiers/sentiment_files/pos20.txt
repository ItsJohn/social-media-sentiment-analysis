@g5clive well said 
@g5maniac Are you a Mac or PC?  Which version are you running?
@g5shanna but i guess it could go either way - with the crap tv that's on these days (reality shows) - drama earns ratings 
@g5shanna LOL! Well, I found mine at Goodwill. My DH, who usually likes me in anything I wear, is not too thrilled with the MuuMuu  LOL!
@G5SMarketing Yea, calling someone out in 140 characters might come across more harsh than helpful. Don't want to hurt any feelings

@geoffkeighley Whoa. Thanks for that... so many leaks at the moment, it's so obvious it's planned 
@GeoffLiving U don't have to &quot;justify&quot; an unfollow but since U made point of mentioning that you were, I thought it worthy of comment 
@GeoffLloyd I agree Geoff. We should get some kind of campaign going... 
@GeoffLloyd I prefer Lund - it seemed enitely populated by attractive young students  Could you not present Bingo Lotto?
@geoffmang Yeah that counts! But it's a lot more G-Rated than something like &quot;The Devil Dared Me To&quot;. It's a must-see. 
@GeoffreyJamil in your case...... seek professional assistance 
@geoffreywolter Hit me up if you've got any questions, I'm usually around. Would be glad to help
