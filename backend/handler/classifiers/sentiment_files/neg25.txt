@m2marianne but... but... there's nice pictures and.. yeah, it's sad as hell. 
@M31ODYx3 Yes it is!!! I had to walk 2 miles home as well today  x
@m3lissad but see, your purse avails you to have them on hand! men are deficient in this aspect of preparedness... 
@m3miA cause he hasn't used what I wanted him to have

@Loquacities Nothing... just disappointed

@LordShaper I'm sorry I haven't written about the Deadpool article yet.  been really busy.
@LordShaper not too much.  but that usually happens when i do something personal for somebody that the audience doesn't know about.
@lordsteve Oh HELL no, leave the blood elves alone.  We have enough problems with names like that.
@lordtiffany27 419-704-3361 Oh and I'll be on my way to Cinci on Saturday so I prob. won't make the shower.
