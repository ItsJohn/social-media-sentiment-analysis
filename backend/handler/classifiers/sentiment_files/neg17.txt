@eunicedebritto the're perfect 2gether  i want a love like this
@hufflepuff4ever Aww! I got an extra $93 from texting added to my phone because certain people have whole conversations daily on twitter. 
@hufflepuff4ever I'm SO jealous.  It rains all the time here but we hardly ever get thunder 
@HUFFPRGirl so they can bring it back up 15mins before the shoe starts 
@Huge_Wang Damnit wang. 
@huggapig yes. In Llandudno. Hence nerves, i'll know half the crowd! 
@huggyb69 Yeah it won't let me upload an image anymore 
@hugh_jackman I found the ending a little sad, because your character forgot about his love interest. 
@HughBlack Sniff, sniff... and I wasn't part of it 
@HughePaul I'm imagining you sat alone at one end of a see-saw. It's so sad 
@hughlaurie and I am not sure which is the fake one 
@hughsbeautiful haha I'm just jealous cause I don't have one! 
@hughsbeautiful nope. FAIL slow internet. 
@hughsbeautiful yes I do believe so.  have you tried to DM again? Xxx
@i6laswegian haha yep, so unfair weve got the 2nd biggest Apple store, which has the longest Genius Bar in the world. Go figure

@hulu any plans to add more HD media soon? it seems to be getting less and less 
@hulu while I know it may not be your fault, I really wish streaming weren't the only option given the demands on my internet connection 
@huma_rashid @SohanaB ahahaha I BOUGHT THEM. all in hardcover, except for the 1st which was a gift from my friend...
