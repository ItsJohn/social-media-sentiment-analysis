@CourtneyChesley @KBestOliver Sounds like it might be a good alternative for working folks!  Is 4:30 to 7:30 a good time for people?
@EastDallasAlice Thank-you for the #followfriday shout out 
@EastDallasAlice Yeah, but with an n! lol 
@eastenderschat glad easties won

@EasyDrinkRecipe I'll swear by it - Orzel Vodka is better! 
@Easyfunk 2298 Artikel. Beat it! 
@easyJetCare ah, ok! thanks for all the info. And I have received Tomaz's email as well.  All great. Thank you very much. 
@EasyLeesy oh my god my fav of yours so far. LOL badgers 
@EasyLocalShopin Is 'I defraud' is the most political sentence? 
@EasyLocalShopin One Hundred Years of Solitude. *Definitely this one*  Then Love in the Time of Cholera. Enjoy!
@easyover13 You have to post a tweet so that I can find you. You lurker you 
@EasyTigerz Better today, was so so hungover yesterday. Going to a birthday party for my friend's kid (she's 1) I'm her godmother 
@Eat_Real OMG that sounds amazing. I'm not sure my son is a raspberry fan, but maybe I should make that version just for me sometime! 
@eatdrinkbekerry beautiful website, had never heard of it b4, must make a trek up to springbrook 
@EatEmAndSmile See, now I have to use an hour of my twitter time to watch it later. 
@eatingjourney Feeling good. A little soar but not that bad. I think I was more prepared for it then I thought. 
@eatingjourney i usually order a skinny latte, i do indulge in a cappucino sometimes, but just that  what abt u?

@Courtneyheaton nothings better than after shitty day at work, walking to the parking lot and seeing your beautiful face there 
@courtneyjoy Hopefully, my future phone.  But I doubt it. It's a high-end company, so it will likely be 3 or 4 times more expensive.

@courtneymariee LMFAO...nah, i havent seen that papps one. link it please.!!

@cozylady I used to have all the wimminz...phone died by 4pm. Now its only NKOTB. @JonathanRKnight can wake me up w/his tweets nightly.

@cpahl2000: I'm glad you like it. It's already one of my faves by her. And yes, I listened to the album. 
@cpaterso any Indochina/Ho Chi Ming materials to share? It is exactly what we are talking in class right now  Thanks!
@cpauwels  my friend calls me the musical dictionary ^^ can't play any instruments but 24/7 listening to my ipod  i do have a guitar ..
@cpayan happy b-day  d-day means a different thing to me, still on a personal basis... think opposite of b-day 
@cpdrurybss thx Chris - look forward 2 seeing it  BTW if you were looking at a web designer's brochure what would make you buy from them?
@cpepicelli yeah okay I'll do that then! 
@cpfcrox i look nothing at all like my mother  http://twitpic.com/5vb7p
@cpfcrox i really don't know, but it works every time 
@cpfcrox She then asked me about twitter, then said *Oh, I got me a qwerty keyboard. I can go there!* She was like 85! So cute 
@cpfcrox sort of based off zachary 
@cpfwebmaster LOL I like her name though 
@cpiercecs yea, and who knows - they may be the next to get a bailout  you know, how can we ask them to live on what they make 
@cpinto and it's based on redhat 
@CPKIII after i typed it i realized most people would look and think 'tasty' instead of 'pretty'

@EbA But the sun is out. You can't have everything you know 
@ebain i'm taking the &quot;break with the occasional study&quot; approach  i do think a dbl date/dinner break would be fab too though.
@ebarthelman 1 perk of being as tall as I am is I can get away with eating more. If I stayed in bed all day, I would still burn 2350 cal 
@ebassman  Can't come to US for the tour so I hope to see you next time in Europe  we talked a lil in Paris xoxox Bon Voyage
