@Nightwyrm  Yes. I think my choice of adjectives implied that.
@Nightwyrm Firefly has the shiniest swear words.  I think I missed the #find3gguy train.
@Nightwyrm my first 1000 took a while but second thousand doesn't seem to have took much time and oddly I blip a lot less than I used to 
@Nightwyrm On the other hand if it's deliberate for artistic effect then fine 
@Nightwyrm would that be before or after a soccer riot? 
@nigs Ah so 15 months. I'm sure he is advanced, and it's not you being biased  they seem to grow up faster these days - now I sound old!
