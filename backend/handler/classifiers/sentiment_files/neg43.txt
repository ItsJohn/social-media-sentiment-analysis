@TweetDeck AHHHH iPhone client just crashed on me 
@tweetdeck great App for the iPhone but it crashed everything 4 to 5 minutes!  
@TweetDeck I'm hoping a new version will come out soon that doesn't crash every 20 minutes for me. 
@TweetDeck Is there any way to enlarge the individual columns? They're so small &amp; dark; not easy to read. 
@TweetDeck nice iphone version, but doesn't support dashes (-) in e-mail address' for tweetdeck accounts  (is supported in AIR version)
@tweetdeck please bring back the 'in reply to' at the bottom of tweets. many threads and meets of new users has been lost 
@TweetDeck Since v0.25.1b deleting my tweets via TweetDeck does delete them from my account, but they remain in TD. 
@tweetdeck where's landscape tweeting in the iPhone app?
