@BTBTheProducer 
@BTCare Hi there. It seems you have disconnected my broadband line but when I called BT Tech Support was unclear on why 
@BTCare Sent u DM, seems to be problem with modem. Had wireless been ordered correctly would have been fine, gotta wait till Tuesday 
@BTCare Thanks, but spent most of the day on the phone to BT, engineer didn't turn up to activate line and the redirect order got lost. 
@BTCare you could try,where do I start? Router keeps going to factory settings and DSL is managing 1.5mbit/s max on a 2km line length 
@AnaLovebug yes I'm alive... I has lost my life to precal, 8 hours a day = 40 hours a week. That makes anyone go crazy 
@analugoncalves http://twitpic.com/59efp - aww, i miss it

@AnansiER I'm 30 years old. If I haven't found it by now, I think it's just about too late. 
@Anant they don't have any unlimited plan for GPRS, they charge 30ps/50kb which is expensive for me 
@anant24121986 it is so unfair that all the good rock shows happen only in B'lore and Pune 
@ananyah part of moving house, my line got disconnected today!  I'm using my phone bluetoothed to my laptop!

@buzz Yuck. That sucks.  I'm only speaking from second hand knowledge. Maybe they tied things down. 
@buzzbishop why? Green not your colour? Seems a trivial reason to unfollow considering the reason for the green. 
@BuzzEdition May I second that sentiment?  Every so often I see that someone has entered the contest...and get my hopes up...but alas, NO 
@BuzzEdition No....it's not fully back.  I've seen more &quot;Fail Whale&quot; appearances since I came aboard.  I thought it was fixed, @Twitter! 
@BuzzNewz  I'm not sick of them, just sad that its come to its present state of being. So sad 
@aplusk amen to that...I miss my football and basketball   http://myloc.me/42wK
