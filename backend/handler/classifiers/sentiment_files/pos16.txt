@conceptDawg Imagine that if you asked some of the places 'what are some good chick rock grunge bands' you might get a few grumpy snobs

@drkilstein I've grown to love Grade B..(bonus..has more nutrients)  
@drkilstein There are a lot of &quot;Social media gurus&quot; on twitter with &lt;30 followers &amp; tweets.  Isn't that kind of similar to the diet prog? 
@drkim27 Oh nothing. It was an idling problem but it's perfect now and was under warranty so yeah!!! I love my car! 
@drklrdbill yea only 23! hahaha it is a little weird to think he cant legally drink. oh well, if nothing else...free dinner
