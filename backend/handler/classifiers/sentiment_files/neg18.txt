@FrugalGaming You got my hopes up with the 120gb hard disk - but without the transfer cable and 2nd hand that's not a great deal imo. 
@FrugalNYC My WP posts w/ tables w/ images w/ captions. The entire post vanishes. Was hoping upgrade would take care of. But it didn't. 
@fruglo I was dressed to kill, I caught the end, want some chips? Mam just woke aodhÃ n up the bint. No fud  poor Africa chillen'
