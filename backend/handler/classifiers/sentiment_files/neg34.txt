@O2 But not as an upgrade presumably? so it'll be a new contract and an end to my loyalty discount. 
@O2 gets nothing is a disgrace! And no more bolt ons either? At the end of this contract bye bye O2 and bye bye iPhone. Such a shame 
@o2 good... but it would have been through the roof if the upgrade package was better 
@o2 Guys, loving my iPhone but have to say the O2 store in Aylesbury was ill-prepared this morning and service very shabby - shame! 
@O2 I'm still waiting   Will I get a text when it's done?
@O2 Where is my MMS  I am still receiving those messages from you when I get an MMS instead of just the picture...can't send any either
@O2 Why cant us iPhone users get better deals than the ones we have currently. Â£35/mo for 500&amp;600? O2 Simplicity is unlimited and 800
