@ClintonSparks  sorry 2 hear that..that's always rough.
@ClintonSparks I told u I tried but 88 said it was 2 late  cause the girl I was with took 4ever 2 get ready. they wanted to meet up by 11.
@clintrevell very cool. Unfortunately I'm rarely allowed to play with things like that any more. 
@clio_jlh it's so inexplicable to me that katy gets that treatment. they respect kris's faith and adam's bfs, so why her? she's *awesome* 
@clio_jlh LOL That's a special kind of magic, though! ;)  And did you see the special on Discovery?  They think Nessie died. 
@Clipz Most of them...
