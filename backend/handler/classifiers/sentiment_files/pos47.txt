@Neilhimself For whatever it is worth.....you have fantabulous hair!!! Enjoy it 
@neilhimself I had one recently-wasn't odd, other than we were hanging out socially. Wishful thinking for Chicago on the 6th.  #neildreams
@neilhimself I like the dream idea.  Then you could invite a competition for art/stories depicting the dream party. 
@neilhimself I love the fact @scalzi calls you a quasi-celebrity - you with 500,000 followers and everything! how rude, LOL  
@neilhimself I was just impressed with that guy who had $1,200 to plunk down on a nudie book with graffiti and post-its in it.  
@neilhimself if you want to meet people after writing, just ask 
@neilhimself London below? 
@neilhimself Look at all this feedback!  You should do it more often, seriously  The crazier the topic, the better.
@neilhimself Speaking of Chicago...no signing after the awards ceremony, but any time else that weekend or shall you be dashing off? 
@neilhimself Think Big, Think Awesome. Think... Stadium? 
@neilhimself Write in a cafe on Rive Gauche. Then you can be like a real writer...oh...wait. 
@neilhimself you rock man! congrats for the audie! 
@neilhimself your hair is one of your defining features without it you would feel less niely to me. 
@neilhimself, don't be such a diva! If your hair looked less like your hair, the magic would be gone.
