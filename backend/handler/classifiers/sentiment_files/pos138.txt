@vikkiness I actually prayed for a sunny day - just so I can do my laundry. After that, I say, bring on the rain! 
@VikkSyn hey love. I'm glad to see ur fingers working 
@VikkSyn I don't do such nonsense...that's what girls are for. Hi Vikk Syn 
@vikkyc sounds like a rather lame chat up to me.  By the way do you come here often 
@Vikraman what's wrong? Isn't chess a form of entertainment?

@vin495 Not on holiday as such, in between contracts, hoping to hear about a role today. Fingers crossed, it'd be a 3 day week.
