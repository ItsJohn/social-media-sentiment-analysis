that was one awesome thunder storm. people keep asking me if i was struck by lightning. did i look weird today or something 
that was probably for the best because i know i will get a homily from my publicist again  but i wanted to share so much though ugh
That was probably the best assembly this year. Kristen wasnt in the DA performance though 
That was so fucking closeeeeeee.  on my way home. Jesus christ.
that was supposed to be a sad face... 
That was supposed to be an upside down smile. 
That was the dumbest thing I've ever typed... 
that was the end ?  #asot400
That was the end of a fantastic Monday 
That was the most fun I've had in a while. Too bad I had to do it alone 
That was the worst night's sleep I've ever had the misfortune to experience 
that was tough 
That was tough  Polo's form handed in. Seeing the room again where I held him was emotional. Feel a bit  but Faithless in my ears helps.
That was unnecessary, learn when to stop? Ouch. 
That was way to close....i really thought the Lakers were about to lose 
that was way to much yesterday. feeling sick. 
That wasn't as bad as my nightmare, but it was up there with it 
That wasnt right!  
That water park wore me out yesterday, I haven't been this sore in some time. 
That wedding was awesome! I finally danced even though it was completely nerdy. I didn't want to leave poor Taylor 
That weird tingling on my neck better not have been a bug 
That went shit. Pure, unadulterated shit.  Least it's over with!  Life, how i've missed you so! 
That would be chris' coffee  - http://bnup2.com/p/584824
that would be 'has been published'....I'm tired 
that you weren't coming to that tour stop.  and I was really disappointed.
thatï¿½s what I call a &quot;suboptimal&quot; sat night: going to a friend to study for an exam till we fall asleep  somebody please cheer me up !!!
That'll be a 'no' then  
'that'll do' frames x 10 bought (Â£30!! - had Â£10!), shed load of mounting to do &amp; tinting of prints...gonna be a long long night!!! 
Thats 3 people i know of who've lost a baby in the last 3 weeks. Sucks hugely 
That's a lot of weight for that poor phone. 
that's a lot to take before 9am. so far my day is starting out badly 
That's a massive allergic reaction.. It's all up both my arms 
That's a negative on the bites @marawitch and @lendmeyoureyes. Drunk wrestling has led to what a neck sprain. No sleep for me last night 
that's an injustice @anz_rocks19 ent to the dentist and she was brave.. they didn't give her a sticker 
That's annyoing! Nobody's in school just few people but most of good people are in Italy  i miss 'someone'
That's because you don't love me no more @boniitaAPPLEBUM. 
That's depressing news. I'm sad now 
That's enough.  Must go to BED.  Notice how I didn't say:  Go to SLEEP.  Sigh.  
THAT'S GOT ME CRAZY, MAN!  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK!...
thats got to be the worst penalty ive ever seen 
Thats Heckkuh funny britt. Its oober hot over here 
THATS HilARi0US MY NiGGA!!!  @SonCeO

That's impossible... He's the perfect 10. But he lives so far away 
That's in 3 weeks. 
thats is sooooooooooooooo annoying. i hate loosing out on opportunities 
That's it - clean up time! Blocking all MLM followers! 
That's it .. done editing 120 items and my bum's numb  tweet tweet Oztion http://bit.ly/bIAUY
thats it! im tying myself to the bed post. im not going anywhere near 50 km close to the airport!!! BOMBAY! 
That's it! No Miyamoto or Pokemon though.

Thats it, what was a lovely Sunday morning has now gone, the kids are up 
Thats it,break time over.Got2go bk2wk now. 
That's it. I'm done with twitterrific 
That's it. I've run out of drinking partners! soft.  NOW - the long walk home...lucky 4 me I snuck out a traveller!!! ;)
thats it. the tears are coming out. its too painful. 
That's it. This ends in blood  #iranelection
That's it.... 
that's just great. I think i broke my pinky toe...how do I manage to do this to myself? 
That's made me sound a little bit like her stalker...trust me I'm not, I'm just a bit worried about her 
That's me having to get up btw, what a shitty sleep I had! Kept waking up every hour, or not even sleeping at all 
That's me off to work. More serving of Alcohol and The Thirsty Camel in Eaglehawk. Hate 8-hour Shifts! 
thats my boyfriend for ya! 
That's my good mood buggered. Libertas didn't run in my constituency and the candidate they suggested I vote for lost apparently 
thats not a very nice thing to say  .. 
That's not cool miz, you don't pick on little people  lol
thats not fair to either of them 
That's not nice! 
That's not very nice @abbensalacup 
That's okay... I didn't want to watch shelby anyway! 
That's probably enough for tonight. A full day of this awaits tomorrow.
