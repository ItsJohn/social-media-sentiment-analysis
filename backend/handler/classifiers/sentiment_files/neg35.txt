@Orchidflower we used to be terrified cos her dog always used to go under her chair when it was up &amp; sometimes got caught in it! 
@Orchidflower yes it would be - she'd taken the dog for a walk &amp; got pulled over - broke hip &amp; shoulder -was never the same after that!

@overtimeagain I am beginning to think that men are overlooked  when it comes to BLOATING. All adverts seem to be geared to the females 
@OvertowDeli @DejaBLade  ahh!!  you're all going to georgia?!   i'm sad now.  the show is on my bday, too!!  dumb job aka school!!
@ovillela Thats the plan! But not sure if the battery will last! 
@ovoro peeps don't really understand the extent of your labors sometimes. Sorry to hear that 
@Owais_Iqbal Oops! I don't remember ... sorry ... 
@Owais_Iqbal yes, no luck.  I will try later again. Or maybe contact the company.
@owalinee pq medinho?

@Owen_Harper OOC I almost cried when Owen and Tosh died.  Why did they have to die? *sighs*
@owenblacker: Also, anyone can buy a .co.uk domain, so it's not quite as clear-cut as we might like. 
@OwenC my Twitter account is only worth $29. how disappointing 
@OwenC Saw Streetview demo on @bbcclick. Neat. Android doesn't fit well with me. HTC Touch HD looks ace, but is WinMo  Still N97 for me
@owengreaves Hey are you on? I cant seem to connect 
@OwenGreaves If you've got any sun could you please send some my way? I'm gonna need to get out the boat any minute now. 
@OwenGreaves I've given the $19.99 question more thought. U may be right. One host provides HD quality to all viewers? Maybe not. 
@simoncveracity Aye, but don't count your chickens yet. There's still a chance of failure - won't know for sure for a while yet 
@Simone haha, i think my skull may be dented.. i've been wearing glasses since i was a kid 
@simone_QoF Thanks for the update  Everyone must be too busy actually talking to each other to bother with us 2D people 
@simonecarlenetm you've been super under the radar lately...starting with the blog. 
@simonech every time I register for community conferences there's something or someone that make me cancel  look forward x your feedbacks.
@SimoneKali i knoo riteee  UGHH
@SimoneLeChat Aww, my mummy can't watch those shows  Animals are too special, why would people be unkind to them.
