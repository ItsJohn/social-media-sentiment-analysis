@kissability I have a friend who is still convinced she wasn't raped by her boyfriend. She said no, but they were dating after all. 
@kissability I try to maintain a playlist of all of my 'favourite' songs, but I just get lost.  The one downside to having 5000+ songs.

@leewaters I don't know the show, but I remember the character from Cheers. I guess the show wouldn't work if he was blissful in Capri. 
@leewaters I'd use it on my laptop if my laptop didn't run XP.  
@leewaters No, you're right. I'm whining. I'm overly attached to one of them and It was just particularly bad timing. 
@leewaters They're not real.  How I wish they were.

@jephjacques I'm sure you've had a hundreds tweets about this already but last speech bubble of panel 2 is broken. 
@jephjacques Nice comic.  But it looks like you lost a text bubble in the second frame.  
@jephjacques That's what happened when I went to NEWW 
@jephjacques You would think hate speech would be, but visceral language draws listeners for both &quot;sides.&quot; 
@jer_deLune It was really boring and lacking any enthusiasm  But on an unrelated note, I want to see Shrek!
@LeoJ1984 Sarcasm is so hard to detect on Twitter
