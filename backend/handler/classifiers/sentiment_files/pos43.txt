@mirwansuwarso 'Jakarta-Time Out' lists '101 Things We Love About  Jakarta'. If you're ready to miss them,  there'd be no downsides 
@mirz112 Dos should be sufficient. I need a backup one and then I'm gonna give one to @Chi_Fashionista as well. 
@mirz112 Yes, two of each. One pair for me and one pair for her. 
@mirzwick Cherry &amp; Lime Otter Pops are almost as good as my Mango Margaritas! Hopefully you'll be out this way with @KellyOlexa.
