@moonfrye Growing up I had the BIGGEST crush on your brother!  Meeno ruled!  I loved his hair, just putting it out there!  Miss him  !
@moonfrye i had my ultrasound and they saw a sac and yolk sac but no baby..please pray that it was too early to see baby 
@moonfrye i know exactly what you mean. I should stay away, but i can't! Must be informed  
@moonfrye I know the surprise now 
@moonfrye i LOVE the hills im gonna miss LC  &lt;Barb ~&gt;
@moonfrye I wish i had half the energy of my kids

@moonfrye it's been raining in Philly for 2 straight weeks!! 
@moonfrye lime is always last.  raspberry was first - but now I am highly allergic.  
@moonfrye My last pick is lemon  
@moonfrye My middle one is starting preschool this year! 
@moonfrye probably THE love of my life..l just need him to open his eyes 
@moonfrye Ruby her parents r Amish &amp; she used to be one of my best friends 
@moonfrye Sorry! Maybe I should expand on my answer. I was an instructor @ community college and it was all about money not education. 
@moonfrye That is sad, why can't some parents let their kids enjoy being young?  
@moonfrye Up here in CANADA ... you would have your butt kicked for that!  How awful.  
@Moonica  not here
@moonlady The more I hear of the story the more depressed I get  Dying in Thailand seems bad enough. I just imagine the surroundings...
@morphiine  because it takes away the time from my work/daughter/husband/sleep. Hence, proved.
@morphogenesis Aww, dammit, where is he right now and why are you apart?  I hope he will be back in your arms soon!!
@Morrica Just hidden behind clouds, think I prefer it this way tho, I just burn in the sun 
@Morrica Norway won it 
@Morrica sorry to hear that  Hope you get well soon!
@Morrigan2711 they will be tracking by IP, twitter loc will not help 
@morrisless Too bad I was sleeping most of the day yesterday and didn't read this until now or I might have stopped by.  
@morrissey0022 yeah I would normally but my parents don't let me when we are spending time  but I can always look back on highlights.
@morriswm I did not know.  Put a twitter thingie on AMV, pweeze?
@morrowkitty *hugs* looks like you've had a rough day, sorry 
@MorSuban nooo i mean the day they started dating  good times, good times... 
@mortade aww, i have many problems,. 
@MortgageHotline @laprimera thank you for the offer.  i appreciate it!!  mortgage companies suck.  
@mortgagereports   are the rates going to improve soon? I need to lock  
@Morticia626 I made the mistake of buying a new iPhone 8 weeks ago. I guess I'm stuck with it for a while 
@Moonlightbay you're not slow it's just that I follow people who tweet 100 times a day and so I miss you ...

@lanaveenker hey I saw your tweet, I hope everything is ok  Ive had this happen to me twice, if the friendship is genuine it will work out
@lanaveenker Jobs would be wonderful!  That's what I'm scouting for right now 
@lance_ Ug, I knew the &quot;Rogers will allow tethering&quot; was too good to be true 
@lancearmstrong i agree , and i didnt like the ending  it just seemed to stop.
@lancearmstrong I'm surprised that this doesn't happen more often.  VA and other military hospitals get some bottom of the barrel doctors

@MuscleNerd @iphone_dev pwnage tool 3.0 crushed on me thrice whilst trying to build costum firmware for iphone 2g 
@musclenerd @iphone-dev it seems you encounter the same problem then me  Intense Debate is down (502 Bad Gateway) Slow down our Website
@MuscleNerd | i hope u have good news for the ones with the 4.30 firmware 
@MuscleNerd Great. redsn0w also crashes on PPC. Are you guys silently abandoning PPC support? 
@MuscleNerd it doesn't work for me  i was on 2.2 and know my iphone is blocked for the Sim.
@musclenerd please some kind of eta I'm after goin over my 50gb cap with all the refreshing 
@MuscleNerd Please, just get us JB for Windows  untweaked, whatever...
@MuscleNerd PwnageTool crashes after unarchiving the ipsw.  (I'm on PPC-10.5.7)
@MuscleNerd so no unlock straight after release? 
@MuscleNerd thanks for the update! was too stupid to wait, now have emer calls only on 2g #iPhone  glad to see you guys are still at it!!!
@MuscleNerd When I use redsn0w on ipt1g, it goes to a blank screen after redsn0w says done. From the comments, this seems common 
@MuscleNerd you reckon a jailbroken iPhone at ver 2.2 can be upgraded to 3.0 and not be bricked? 
@MuscleNerd: any update about ultrasn0w? Its becoming late here....time to sleep 
@muse_queen Hmm. I can't think of a cool way to twist your boardie name.
