@FlissTee Oh love that one 
@FlissTee Oh, fabulous ta.  I'm with the coffee too, obviously, although my cup is not large enough to embrace which is its deficiency.
@FlissTee Or i could just move the island, go back in time and have one with the crew! 
@FlissTee pleasantly quiet and rainy.... we have chicken with a sort of salsa-ey coating in the slow cooker smelling nice too 
@FlissTee thank you

@foodandhowtoeat wonder if your grampo knew my grampo 
@foodblogethics great stuff!  ethics is not a shackle of free speech. Accountability/responsibility, in fact helps improve its quality 
@foodieguide ah well - i'll look forward to the review anyway 
@foodieguide oh so cool  when its on flickr I wanna see!
@foodiemcbody Not only are there too many but reading them is somewhat addictive in itself   Looking for the &quot;answer&quot; I suppose.
@foodiemcbody taking calcium also helps to keep everything strong and avoid injury. Hope this helps 
@foodiePrints nice!! I wonder how it might turn out with just plain granola, fresh berries and a touch of yoghurt instead 
@foodiePrints what's Grace Ottawa? I was born at the Grace Hospital. That's what I thought you meant at first. 
@foodiesarah motivations to blog? diverse and sundry, surely!  for me, it's always self-expression and knowledge sharing #blogging
@foodiesarah oh yes! I've also contributed to the discussion about the previous one  in the same place as all of you
@Foodimentary well that would be true on many levels. Wife is Wiccan and has many books on magick in the kitchen.  Her food is quite good.
@FoodMage That's true -- we're a rare breed. 
@foodphilosophy I know what you mean. You can look at bounce backs then send email to yahoo &amp; so on... They will clear your URL.

@FoOie I agree, kudos to @CarlGriffith for organising this #sgtweetup 
@FoOie I was trying to quote Thomas Jefferson, but I believe that it was misattributed to him 
@FoOie That reminds me of an episode of House, where Wilson tells Cuddy to stop making up standards no one can live up to. Classic 
@FoOie While wuxia need chi, the misborn need various metal to augment their strength, agility and lightness. Yeah physics is used a lot 
@foole_of_hearts they're trying to get themselves hooked up. I'm a happily engaged woman.
