@snipeyhead @sdwrage Little does she know that I am too, but let's keep that between us.  
@snipeyhead Change that &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Anonymous&quot; and you've got my entry.  
@snipeyhead Eh, I knew what you meant. 
@snipeyhead Gary is straight forward,  though Christy gives me hope 4 my own future 
@snipeyhead Hey, haven't seen you since we squared off on SuperBowl Sunday. How've you been? 
@snipeyhead How many people are you talking about, and what do you consider expensive? &quot;Decent-sized&quot; may be a bit subjective.  
@snipeyhead http://twitpic.com/6f1eq - You're funny. Awesome! Love your lipstick color too!! 
@snipeyhead LOL!! No, thankfully. More like I sneezed all over myself. 
@snipeyhead That is ok, plagiarizing is tip #134

@snkysndsystm it may be cold outside but we'll turn the Bedford into a furnace! Going to be massive, Chch is amped. 
@snobahr I can understand not liking them. A 5.0 is not a lot to fear. Just a very big vibrator set to stun.  
@snobiety glad to have helped! so much btr control w/ selective twitter app!  
@snodgethebodge @Immaculata hah, sorry. been away for the a day. Not sure about the name yet. He is sleeping all day anyway.

@Snoop71  Hey, I'm trying to put on my best Pollyanna.  WORK with me! 
@Snoop71 No, this fits right in. One little wedge is very low in calories and dark chocolate is good for you! Just can't eat entire tin! 
@snoopoz I guess if you can't love all things that come from a pig - so if you must only choose 3, yours will do. 
@snoopy874 A 40 is a pass in England.  But no one gets above an 80, so it evens out. This exam's only worth 50%, I got a 78% on c/w.
@SnoopySleuth51 me too! i was like, &quot;why thank you !!&quot;
