@TheFamulus Good afternoon  Yeah we've been told we'll have rain by Friday and it'll last all weekend and possibly into next week too 
@TheFamulus I scoff at midnight. I fell asleep at 7pm! That said, I miss the days of living happily on 4 hours a night 
@TheFamulus Possibly. I meant between the repeated pregnancies and dying in childbirth. Several times, in fact. But only one orgy. 
@TheFamulus We had a bit of rain early yesterday and then quite a nice day. A bit chilly and windy though. Very grey today 
@thefashionisto I can't see it. My computer hates me.
