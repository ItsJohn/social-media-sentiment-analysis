#tweetdeck on the iphone is sweet. It has a wonderful column view, etc. It syncs your columns and groups but does NOT sync what is read. 
#Tweetdeck's rate limit is not fun. I have 4 computer's behind NAT, all using #tweetdeck for the same user. It burns API calls in minutes 
#twidroid has been updated to 2.1.7. Not sure what's changed yet. Wish they'd revert back to the old app icon though
