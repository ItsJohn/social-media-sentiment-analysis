@Akelaa Ok, I have bites all over, it's hot, we're just friends, I'm miserable. Better? 
@Akelaa something like that.  and if i can have my way with it, maybe it will unload itself tomorrow.  hrmm...

@akfarrell The use of too many weights isnâ€™t beneficial to the page organization. Cursive makes for fine emphasis, when used sparingly 
@AKGovSarahPalin  i resemble that remark  
@AKGovSarahPalin Good for you. AK may be the last place in America where freedom reigns. (PS: You're up very late)  
@AKGovSarahPalin Great Op-Ed Gov... I completely agree with you. DC's screwed up everything already... don't need them screwing us more!
