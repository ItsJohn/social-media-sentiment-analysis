NIN &amp; Jane's Addiction were amazing, we had incredible seats &amp; @davenavarro6767 is my new best friend 
NIN are the shit 
NIN was good, it stormed, and apparently a tornado touched down, but it was entirely fitting. Everyone was wet and screaming / dancing. 
life is never about the people who act true in front of you.. its always about the people who remain true behind your back. 
Life is not about surviving the storm, its about dancing in the rain 
life is not that complicated, its what we make out of it.  
Life is one of my favorite movies. 
life is short . Live your life better . I just learn from OTH . Quenti is gone , forever . But he will still stay in friends heart
