@enki09 HA! you're on a roll....there's no stopping you... 
@enki09 W2 is almost certainly a good thing (like the EU and UN!): I just doubt the most optimistic hopes for its effect, that is all 
@Enkou_Kitsune It's ironic. You didn't come down for weather this weekend, and the only rain we saw was a light rain on Saturday. lol. 
@ENMagnifico you for sure do al. geeze you should know that already. the hawtness! OMG.

@Darn_Republican Really? Palin showed restraint/class with &quot;Wouldn't let my daughter near him?&quot; And &quot;DarnRepublican&quot; calling me partisan? 
@darnell you know what we're waiting for 
@Darnell0216 yeah, we're fixing bugs as quickly as we find them.  Every time we publish a fix, the site slows down. Such is life. 
@darnell352 hell yeah! We can stay at the Hooters hotel lol maybe we'll get a good rate since your a big wig there 
@DarnellWright I guess that answers my Question earlier 
@DarnellWright I need to see you on TV ASAP! You stay crackin me up... If I had a comedy show I would put you on it! lol 
@DarnellWright No problem 
@DarnWright wasn't bad. The first round had mostly e3 questions so I bombed. Second round was general stuff so I kicked some SRRS arse. 
@DarnYouMiko Download them all online? 
@DarqueReviews  Is Vampire Bill back in this one?  She's still hoping Sookie ends up with him...  I just read your review...  Sounds good!
@darraghdoyle @TheBigSwitchIRL Maybe 22, but defo not 23! ;-) The issue is Second 22/23. 2 switches+frontplate NOT 3 switches!

@ensredshirt I know you're not Patrick...I was just responding to your quote with another quote....die hard fanigirl- kinda have to do it 
@ensredshirt I should've known that. Clearly, I am more of a Doctor Who fan than BTTF. 
@ensredshirt I totally agree our ships are ugly. Asgard ships are sweet! Ur not a *stalker* if you like Sam. Not in my opinion, anyway. 
@ensredshirt Yeah, but that'd be why the Valen got the living crap blown out of it.  Don't forget the Sulaco and Nostromo.
